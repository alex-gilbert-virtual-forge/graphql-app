## Getting Started

First, run npm install in the route directory:

```bash
npm i
```

Now, change to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

Now, run npm install in the client directory:

```bash
npm i
```

Now, go back to the route directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

Finally, run the following command in the route:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run both the server.js and client side at the same time :)
